## Notes
### Bronco

Bronco is my personal developed from scratch PHP template engine. It's still in the works, but it is definitely usable right now.
The goal behind is to allow whoever is templating to not be concerned about the intrincities of PHP or server code.
With Bronco, page designers can focus on creating clean, maintable, and solid document structure in their pages.
Bronco achieves this by not following the convention of using brackets ( sucha s [[foo]] or {{foo}} ), instead relying on inherit HTML formatting.

Bronco is still a work in progress, and in any project you are not required to utilize it. There is always the good ole PHP Template engine which will simply take 
a PHP page and pass in the variables in typical template style. Going this route is initially simpler, and quicker to port over to, but the built in features in Bronco
( such as page caching ) make it the more desired choice of tool. Additionally Bronco will be receiving a multitude of features in the future that the simpler PHP Template engine just won't see.
